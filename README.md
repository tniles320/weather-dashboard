# Weather Dashboard

![weather dashboard screenshot](images/screenshot.png)

The weather dashboard allows you to search for a city's current  weather and five day forecast.<br>
A city that is searched will be stored in a list that can be called back on at any time.<br>
The city list will only store 10 cities, so any city searched after 10 will remove older cities from the list.<br>

*Bugs*<br>
If an input is enetered that doesn't generate a response, no data will be displayed and the input text
will be displayed in the city list.<br>
If it is before 12pm, day 5 of the 5 day forecast will not display.
